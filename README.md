#DecorJS: 3Ding the web

The web is ever changing. In a few years time many websites will likely be 3D interfaces instead of flat HTML pages.
This framework is for experimenting with and building such environments.

####What is DecorJS?

DecorJS is a framework, or rather *engine* to provide easy JSON-object to HTML output.

It works in *scenes*, which are defined as a single JS Object.

####Performance

DecorJS is a very lean little JS file which uses the maximum available browser power for page rendering.
Performance is maximized and it provides minimal CPU overhead and memory footprints.

####Compatibility

DecorJS works seamlessly in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari. Apart from a few minor technicalities
it works on IE10+. It's also platform independent and works on browsers in iOS, Android and MS Surface-devices.

####Getting started
All you need to get started is a little JS and CSS knowledge. Forget about HTML.

####Todos
Expanding this README, writing documentation and many other things.

####Issues
When using scenes with many (hi-res) graphics, some browsers don't render everything. This is predominantly the case in IE and Chrome. There are also some IE-specific issues due to lack of support for cool stuff like CSS `pointer-events`.

####Website & demos
On their way.
